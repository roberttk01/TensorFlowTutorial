# TensorFlorTutorial

### About
These are companion scripts, modules, and packages from going through sentdex's Machine Learning
playlist on Youtube. Applicable links may be found in the **Acknowledgement** section below.

#### Note Concerning requirements.txt: 
There are a slew of requirements that *pip freeze* wrote to requirements.txt. However,
the only two packages that need to be installed are NumPy and TensorFlow. The rest of their dependencies will be installed
with the these two packages.
